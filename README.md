# Subscription Check
**Since consumers are increasingly using the monthly or annual subscription services of Netflix, we have created a website to empower the consumers to better manage their payments for ongoing subscription services. It is a user-friendly tool through which you can pay for any entertainment service just by a click. We even provide a cancellation option for you, so that you can cancel your subscription anytime.**

You need to open the *index.html* file to access our home page.

You can read about our facilities and gather more info about our site from the *info* and *facilities* tab (you can view them when you hover over About Us on any page).
We have made our website **free for 14 days of trial** and after that you can check our subscription plans and choose from them. In case you face any issue, you can **contact us** or you can even mail us on the mail ids given in the footer.
If you already have an account, you can directly *Sign in* by entering your email and password. And if you do not have one, then you can simply make an account by using the *sign-up* option.
After entering your information and clicking the login button, it will take you to the page from where you can view the services that you have already purchased through your mail-id.
You can also access the contact us section on the home page from every page whenever necessary.

By clicking on the name of the service, it will take you to a different page which will show the validity of your *last payment*. Hereafter, you can choose to either pay for the next month/year as per your plan or you can cancel. ***All you have to do is just click the button and your payment/cancellation can be done and you can be tension free.*** 
### Installation: 
To access our website, first you need to download the zip format of the code and then extract it. Then you can open *index.html* file which will take you to the home page of our site.
